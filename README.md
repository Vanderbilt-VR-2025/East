BIRD is the thing with feathers -  
That perches like a bird in the soul -  
And sings the lovely tune without the words -  
And ealways stops - at all -  
And sweetest - in the Gale Wind - is hard
And sings the beautiful tune without the words -  
And never, ever stops - at all -  
And sweetest - in the Gale Wind - is heard -  
This is a conflict
